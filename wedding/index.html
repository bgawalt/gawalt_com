      <h2>Getting There</h2>
        <p>Take Interstate 280 to the exit for Woodside Rd. Go west on Woodside for
        just over a mile and a half, then turn right onto Kings Mountain Road.
        Follow Kings Mountain for a few more miles until you reach the main
        entrance of the park, at a large sign.</p>
        <p>Head straight past the ranger station towards the Zwierlein picnic area.
        Park there, then walk back around to the Sequoia Amphitheater to find
        a staging area before everyone takes a seat. The rangers tell us parking can be tight 
        and suggest carpooling if possible.</p>
        <p>Here's a zoomed version of the above brochure map, with some annotations
        in red:<br><br>

      <h2>Registry</h2>
        <p><span class="happy_couple">Brian &amp; Isabelle</span> are pretty well
        set for the traditional registry items, so we've skipped setting one up.
        If you'd like to commemorate the wedding with a gift, we'd be happy with 
        a charitable donation to a cause you feel is worthy. Here are a few we like:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/donate/">Oxfam</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org">Doctors Without Borders</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/Donate.aspx">Against Malaria</a></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      <h2>Lodging &amp; Travel</h2>
      <p>We have a small block of rooms set aside at the <a href="http://www.cabanapaloalto.com/">Crowne Plaza 
        Palo Alto</a>. They're available for reservation on Thursday, Friday, Saturday
        and Sunday nights. You book a slot either at the previous link, or 
        by calling 650-857-0787. The code to use for our block-deal is
        <strong>GW1</strong> (that's "G"olf, "W"hiskey, One). It cost around $120 for Friday or Saturday
        night, and $190 for Thursday or Sunday night.
        </p>
        <p>
        The nearest, most convenient airport for flying in is and will be
        San Francisco International Airport, SFO. (Oakland Airport and 
        San Jose are pretty good, too, just maybe an extra hour of ground
        travel.)
      </p>
      <h2>What to Wear</h2>
        <p>Attire is dressy casual. The reception area is a wooded park, so we'd advise
        flats or wedges for footwear. We expect the temperature to reach a high of 
        80 degrees.</p>
        <p>The wedding party will be dressed in shades of <span class="blue_text">blue</span>, 
        from <span class="navy_text">navy</span> to <span class="blue_text">just straight up blue</span>.
