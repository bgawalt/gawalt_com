      <h2>Getting There</h2>
        <p>Take Interstate 280 to the exit for Woodside Rd. Go west on Woodside for
        just over a mile and a half, then turn right onto Kings Mountain Road.
        Follow Kings Mountain for a few more miles until you reach the main
        entrance of the park, at a large sign.</p>
        <p>Head straight past the ranger station towards the Zweirlein picnic area.
        Park there, then walk back around to the Sequoia Amphitheater to find
        a staging area before everyone takes a seat. The rangers tell us parking can be tight 
        and suggest carpooling if possible.</p>
        <p>Here's a zoomed and annotated version of the above brochure map:<br>

      <h2>Registry</h2>
        <p><span class="happy_couple">Brian &amp; Isabelle</span> are pretty well
        set for the traditional registry items. So we're not expecting gifts.
        If you feel like commemorating the wedding with some matrial generosity,
        (a) thank you, very much! and (b) we'll decide on a charitable fund to
        which we'd love to hear about your donation.
        </p>
      <h2>Lodging &amp; Travel</h2>
      <p>We have a small block of rooms set aside at the <a href="http://www.cabanapaloalto.com/">Crowne Plaza 
        Palo Alto</a>. They're available for reservation on Thursday, Friday, Saturday
        and Sunday nights.
        </p>
        <p>
        The nearest, most convenient airport for flying in is and will be
        San Francisco International Airport, SFO. (Oakland Airport and 
        San Jose are pretty good, too, just maybe an extra hour of ground
        travel.)
      </p>
      <h2>What to Wear</h2>
        <p>Dressing up is good! We're not aiming for tuxedoes or evening gowns,
        but something that shows up in the photo album as "made an effort" would
        be appreciated. </p>
        <p>One place to take it extra casual, though, might be the footwear department.
        Part of our ceremony is all of us taking a pleasant, ten minute stroll through
        the redwoods, between the amphitheater and the reception area.
        It's a wooded nature trail, maintained by the park, but not paved.
