      <h2>Parking</h2>
      <p>We expect parking to be a bit tight. It's first-come, first-served, in
      a public park, and all the large group picnic areas in the park
      are already completely booked up. Carpooling is encouraged, and Uber and Lyft
      both say they'll run pickups from inside Huddart Park given a 15-20
      minute wait.</p> 
      
      Our recommendation for carpoolers would be to park near the Zwierlein area and
      walk over to the Amphitheater. There's a paved road (no sidewalk) from there
      to the ceremony in the Amphitheater, or you can take...

      <h2>The Nature Trail!</h2>
      <p>Here's a walkthrough from Zwierlein to the Amphitheater through
      the park itself. The total distance is one-sixth of a mile.
      Iz stop to take some photos on a seven minute walkthrough:</p>
      <p>(1) Starting here from Zwierlein, head off to the right:</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_01.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(2) Here's what the trail looks like as you're starting out:</p>
      <img src="img/trail//trail_02.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(3) When you come to this gate, head on through it:</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_03.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(4) The trail. It's nice! We like redwoods.</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_04.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(5) You'll reach this trail marker, and you want
      to head uphill, to the right. The marker should indicate
      "TO SEQUOIA DAY CAMP", up and to the right:</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_05.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(6) From here, there are no more forks or turns.
      Just a nice path, with redwood saplings and madrone trees.</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_06.jpg" width="400" >
      <img src="img/trail/trail_07.jpg" width="400" >
      <img src="img/trail/trail_08.jpg" width="400" >
      <img src="img/trail/trail_09.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(7) As the trail starts to open up like this, you're
      reaching the end:</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_10.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(8) And this is it! The Amphitheater picnic area.
      We'll have some drinks waiting, where everyone can relax
      until walking on over to the amphitheater itself.</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_11.jpg" width="400" >
      <p>(9) Then the ceremony happens.</p>
      <img src="img/ceremony.gif" width="400" >
      <p>(10) On the way back, stay to the right.</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_12.jpg" width="400" >   
      <p>(11) Here's our old friend, the sign post from step (5).
      Follow it towards the Zwierlein area, off to the left.</p>
      <img src="img/trail/trail_13.jpg" width="400" >

      <p>Once we're all back and settled after the ceremony,
      we'll start in on:</p>

      <h2>The Food!</h2>

      <p>We've arranged a Greek buffet to be catered back in the
      Zweirlein area. If you have questions or concerns about dietary
      restrictions, please let us either know directly or in the RSVP
      form. But! We should have you covered. Brian's got a nut allergy,
      so no worries there, Greek cuisine means the gluten-avoiders
      should be fine, and there's vegetarian fare to boot.</p>
