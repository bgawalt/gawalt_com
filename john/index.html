<h2>About me</h2>
<ul>
<a>I am a Chemical Engineering student enrolled at Virginia Tech with an expected graduation date in May, 2016. In addition to my studies, I am employed at Squires Food Court, <a href =http://www.dining.vt.edu/about/index.html>VT  Dining Services.</a> In my spare time I enjoy hiking, playing the bass guitar, reading, and modifying/building computers.

<h2>Relevant Coursework </h2>

<h3>Solvent Recovery and Recycle</h3>
My partner, Jaired Re, and I completed the 1998 version of the <a href =https://www.aiche.org/sites/default/files/node/aiche-student-design-competition/1998-StudentDesignContent-Solvent-Recycle-from-a-Siloxane-Process_0.pdf>AIChE design competiton</a> as part of our Process and Plant Design course. We designed, optimized, and streamlined a theoretical process to separate toluene and acetonitrile from waste streams and return them to a siloxane polymerization unit for reuse as high-grade solvents. We used ASPEN+ to carry out all relevant design work and calculations. A full breakdown of our project can be viewed <a href=Gawalt_Re_Designproject.pdf>here</a>.
