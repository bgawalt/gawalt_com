        Edutainment on the Internet Archive
    </h1>

    <p>
        Here are some fun edutainment-type games, remembered from my own childhood, that my kids play 
        in a browser on my laptop,with a mouse and keyboard.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        All of these run as JavaScript apps in a DOSBOX emulator. And it's easy to accidentally
        exit the game, which means the DOS command <b>"dir"</b> comes in handy to list the files in
        the directory in order to find the name of the EXE file you invoke to get back into the
        game.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Snap_Dragon_1992">SnapDragon (1992):</a></b>
            Two game modes: a floodfill-only coloring book sideshow, and a main even of rearranging
            tiny figures/sprites around a scene and then clicking "take (save) photo for later
            viewing in an album." The saved photos really do persist across sessions. No reading
            required.

            <b><a href="https://archive.org/details/RABBIT_EGA">Reader Rabbit (1987):</a></b>
            Three simple reading exercises chained into games: pick the word that's exactly one
            letter different from the given word; decide whether a word is trash-or-treasure based
            on whether it matches a pattern like "?AP" or "CO?"; a memory tile games matching
            pictures to their words. Only requires reading three-letter words. Kinda dull, though.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b><a href="https://archive.org/details/RFL_EGA">Reader Rabbit's Ready for Letters (1992):</a></b>
            Click around to guide Reader Rabbit through his grandparent's house. Lots of mini-games,
            not a lot of actual reading required (but plenty of chances to read and so do slightly
            better at the games).
        </li><br>        

        <li>
            <b><a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Super_Solvers_Treasure_Mountain_1990">Super Solvers: Treasure Mountain (1990):</a></b>
            Wander through three levels of a mountain, snaring little elves and solving their
            riddles to find each key to the next level. A first grade reading level should be
            enough, though I help my kindergartner by me reading the riddle and him reading the
            multiple-choice options.
        </li><br>

        <li>
            <b><a href="https://archive.org/details/lemmings_20230825">Lemmings (1991):</a></b>
            The original classic puzzle game. My kindergartner's still growing the reflexes and
            dexterity for him to advance past level six or so, but we have fun where he tells me
            what to do and then I do the clicking. Not all that educational, but definitely fun.
            <b>Note:</b> this doesn't auto-launch for me, I have to go through a doomed initial
            launch attempt, arrive at a DOS prompt, and type "lemmings" to enter the actual
            successful launch flow ("VGA"&nbsp;-&#8288;>&nbsp;"For&nbsp;PC&nbsp;Compatibles").
        </li><br>
        
        <li>
            <b><a href="https://archive.org/details/ODELL_201905">Odell Down Under (1994):</a></b>
            Pick a species of Great Barrier Reef dweller to play as, then click around eating food
            and avoiding predators. Requires a second-grade level of reading to really understand
            what's going on, though, so this doesn't get a lot of play from us right now. Some day!
