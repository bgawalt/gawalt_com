Oh, let's all give a cheer for Pagus /
He's the god of our jobs and our wages /
I tell ya, this guy is out-ra-geous /
So let's tithe a coin, to Pagus/

Pagus has a plan for me and you /
and for record high earnings by Quarter 2 /
Just do anything he asks of you /
And we'll all get rich off Pagus /

Take any rich man that you're like to meet /
And ask him how he found his way to Easy Street /
It's a solid gold lock that he'll then repeat /
"I owe it all cuz I tithe - to Pagus!"

Well, I've got the god that you've got to know /
If you wanna optimize your cash flow/
He's your god for buyin' high and for selling low /
It's your new best friend: it's Pagus!
